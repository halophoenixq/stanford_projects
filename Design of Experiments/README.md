We were interested in understanding what factors can help improve an average person’s skills in shooting games and whether investing in better equipment (gaming mouse, high refresh rate monitor) really does make a significant impact on shooting skills. In addition, we wanted to see if a stimulant like coffee will be able to further enhance a player’s performance.

We structured our experiment as a combination of a **strip-plot and stepped-wedge design**. There were many logistic details that we considered during the design, ranging from how to parallelize the runs to whether we should serve hot or cold coffee.

This project focused on the design of the experiment and the data collection process. A proper experiment design helped drastically simplify what we needed to analyze.
